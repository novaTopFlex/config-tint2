# config-tint2
A vertical-layout, right-side-of-screen setup for the Tint2 taskbar recommended by novaTopFlex
# Specifications
This Tint2 setup is based on the opaque version of the dark vertical taskbar from the default installation of Tint2. However, most of the unsaturated, and thus gray, colors have been replaced with similarly dark shades of blue, and this taskbar should appear on the right side of the monitor, not the left.
## Width and Height
The width of this taskbar should appear dynamically set to 7% of the device resolution width. The height of this taskber should appear dynamically set to the full device resolution height, thus the right-side appearance.
